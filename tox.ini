# Tox (https://tox.readthedocs.io/) is a tool for running tests in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file helps
# to run the test suite against different combinations of libraries and Python versions.
# To use it locally, "pip install tox" and then run "tox --skip-missing-interpreters" from this directory.

# Mapping of Python versions (MAJOR.MINOR) to Tox factors.
# When running Tox inside GitHub Actions, the `tox-gh-actions` plugin automatically:
# 1. Identifies the Python version used to run Tox.
# 2. Determines the corresponding Tox factor for that Python version, based on the `python` mapping below.
# 3. Narrows down the Tox `envlist` to environments that match the factor.
# For more details, please see the `tox-gh-actions` README [0] and architecture documentation [1].
